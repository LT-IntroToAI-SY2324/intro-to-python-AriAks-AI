# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
I knew a little bit about the language python before this class but I think that it will be fun to learn more about the incorporration of AI.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

I like how in python vs Javascript I don't have to add in a semi colon at the end of a phrase because I feel like it got a lot of errors for me in my APCSP assignments. I also like how we get to use VS CODE becuase it gives all the tips before you enter in the code that your doing.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I learned that I can do |variable += x | in order to simplify |variable = variable + x| which I really like. I also like the format of the loops and functions in python becuase it is very simple and recognizable to the code that I am used to
